# Making a choice

Until now, I have been managing a VPS which has become more and more 
resource demanding as I run different projects and processes.

It occurred to me that this was mainly unncessary!  While it was a great
tool for me to learn how to manage things like Node and Nginx.  I also 
ran databases like MySQL and Mongo and learned how to manage different 
processors and environments such as PHP and WordPress.

I decided that my projects needed a more stable environment where I could 
also manage the project versions and source control.  I was already using 
GitHub to manage the code for my projects so moving to GitHub Pages was
almost a no-brainer.

# PixelFlux

The first project to be migrated over to GitHub Pages was PixelFlux:
