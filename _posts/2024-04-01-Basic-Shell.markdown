# Up and running

So...  After a week or so of fooling around I now have the basic shell of 
this website up and running.  I had thought there would be a much steeper 
learning curve than this but it seems I was wrong.  There are a lot of new
technologies and processes that are new to me and I have had to navigate 
all of them to get to this point.

# New skills

## Jekyll

Using Jekyll for the first time for staging this site has been surprisingly 
easy.  The GH Pages implementation is easy to use and the themes embed in a 
very simple way.  Also, the way that content is modularised makes it great
for things like my [Artwork Gallery](/content/traditional-artwork.md).

Also, being able to mix and match the HTML and Markdown content makes composing
docs like this blog post very simple and takes the pain out of putting up new
content.

## Liquid

Had never heard of liquid before but the Jekyll implementation has great documentation
as does the Liquid website.  The notation of variables and negotiation of frontmatter, 
has been really nice to work with.  It is very powerful considering its relative simplicity
and processing things like arrays of documents and posts has been great.

## Ruby

I have never used Ruby as a programming language before.  I am not sure I intend to start 
now but running Jekyll locally allows for some powerful plugins through the Gem system which
I did experiment with at length.  It is certainly something I may consider in the future.

## Markdown

There are many flavours of markdown in use across the internet and I get mixed up sometimes.  
Using markdown for this side as a document source has been not so much a learning experience
but more of a refresh of my appreiation for markdown in general.

## Git and GitHub

I have been using these in various ways for many years but preparing a site in this way has 
allowed me to look at the ways I have been using Git and GitHub and maybe understand how
others may get different benefits from these services.  Never too old to learn new tricks.

# What's next?

I really don't know... I guess I will continue to drop my thoughts and ideas in here and then see
where it takes me.  PixelFlux will continue to bubble along as normal now that it is hosted on GH
and other projects and ideas are swimming around too.  At least I know I have somewhere I can, at
the very least, air my dirty laundry :D
