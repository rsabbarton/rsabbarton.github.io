# Well... This is awkward

In short, I have been very shy in interacting with the build process and 
preferred, historically, to work in just JavaScript ES6 and avoid plugins
and modules that could have made my life easier.  The reason being is
that, well... I like the challenge.  It is one of the reason why I code
so using plugins and modules used to feel like flicking to the back pages
of a crossword book or getting clues to a sudoku.

# Why Jekyll?

GH Pages and the hosting of Jekyll here allows me to experiment with using 
these plugins while actually acheiving something.  There is actually a purpose
to me creating this site in GitHub and not just for the challenge.

# Where am I at?

Until last week, I was running a VPS and hosting a number of projects through
Node, Express, Nginx, HTML and Javascript.  But I realise that actually, as a 
"developer" I would probably have limited exposure to these tools which are 
predominantly back-end.  I wrote my own CMS to manage the pages and used my 
own templating engine to prepare and serve files through Express.

Now, my VPS is gone, shut-down, destroyed, uninstantiated, nullified, and OFF.
But I want to continue my path towards becoming a better developer.  Building this
site through GitHub Pages and using Jekyll to manage the templating and conversion
from markdown is a way for me to attack this from a different angle.

# What are my goals

## 1. Create a website

I want to create this site not for the "challenge" but as a place where I can showcase
my work, not only as a developer but as an artist and a musician.

## 2. Learn to use Jekyll

I am always trying to learn as much as I can through all of the projects I start, complete,
pause and even abandon.

## 3. Learn more about Git/GitHub and version control in general

Again, I have very little experience using Git and always found my own ways of controlling versions
and iterations within my projects.

## 4. Have Fun...  

Coding has always been enjoyable to me.  So I save the best for last.
