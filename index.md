## Musician, artist, developer, IT professional and all round comedy genius!

Maybe some of these are only partially true.  I love to code and have written
in many languages including:
 - JavaScript
 - PHP
 - Perl
 - C++

I play the guitar and piano and I love to draw and paint both mixed media and 
digitally.
