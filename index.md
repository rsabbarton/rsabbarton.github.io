# Page Heading 1

This is my first paragraph on the page.  
I hope it looks OK as I am still learning how to use Jekyll and GH Pages and Kramdown to get all this stuff working.  
It looks like I am going to need to host some static files so I may need to work out how to do that with the
Jekyll processor.

## Something New

Hopefully this works out just grand.
